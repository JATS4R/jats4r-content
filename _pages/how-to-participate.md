	<li><a href="#join-calls">Join the calls and help develop the recommendations</a></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="send-xml">Send us your XML samples!</h2>
We would like to see as many full-text XML samples as possible from publishers so that we can best represent how people are tagging their content when we make our recommendations. The samples are for analysis only so that we get a full picture of how JATS is being used. We won't share your samples, and if you like, we can anonymise them (or you can do that yourself before sending). Please send samples to jats4r[at]gmail.com.
<h2 id="join-calls">Join the calls and help develop recommendations</h2>
JATS4R meets biweekly by conference call to develop its recommendations. All are welcome. Call details are announced in the JATS4R Main Google mail list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jats4r), as well as via Twitter (@jats4r). You can always <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/134cXv6KY0Py0E0KsgEL1ExvkkcWfEa3wKsMmV353T38/edit" target="_blank">have a look at the agenda</a> prior to each call.
<h2 id="subscribe">Subscribe to the JATS4R Google mailing lists to follow along and help by commenting or reviewing</h2>
JATS4R has two Google mail lists (mail forums), and both are public and open to anyone interested:
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jats4r">Main JATS4R list</a> (aka the 'big' list) is where JATS4R puts out any public notices, such as notices of upcoming recommendation discussions or tagging recommendation announcements</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jats4r-admin">JATS4R Admin list </a>is for all adminstrivia related to JATS4R. We use this forum for such things as collaborating on abstracts for conferences, communications projects, validator tool discussions, and anything else that is related to running or organising JATS4R</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contribute-validator">Contribute work on the validator tool</h2>
Whether you are interested in the validator tool, schematron, or just helping to test the tool, JATS4R needs your help. The validator tool team communicates via a Slack channel. To join, just email jats4r@gmail.com (subject line: validator tool) for an invitation to join.
