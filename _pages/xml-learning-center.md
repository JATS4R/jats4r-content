<h1>Control your content: Learn about XML</h1>
Scholarly content moves knowledge and understanding from author to audience, a transfer that depends on quality XML. Today it is more important than ever for content creators to take ownership of their XML mark-up choices. And who better to participate in this than the people closest to the content in your organization?

XML is not just for technology people; JATS XML is an accessible data format that anyone can learn! JATS4R believes that the efficiency and quality of XML creation could be improved by enabling more people to understand and make decisions related to their XML. To help with this, JATS4R has developed some resources that anyone can use. On this site you will find
<ul>
	<li>Our <a href="http://jats4r.org/xml-topics/">XML topicsÂ page</a>, which contains a list of articles on various aspects of XML in general, JATS XML in particular, and XML-related technologies, like schematron</li>
	<li>An <a href="http://jats4r.org/xml-faq">XML FAQ section</a></li>
</ul>
